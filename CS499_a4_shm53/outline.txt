CS499 Homework 4 Problem

There will be a certain amount of bakers, each bake cookies in their own oven (it's always hot)

What each baker has to do:

// Baker thread
for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
work (i.e., prepare dough, cut cookies, put them on a baking sheet)
get oven mitts from the oven mitt rack
put cookies in the oven
wait for cookies to be baked
remove cookies from the oven
put oven mitts back onto the oven mitt rack
}


In the pseudo-code above the “work” and “wait for cookies to be baked” operations simply print a
message to standard out and then sleep a random number of microseconds (using usleep) between 2 and 5 seconds. 

The “put cookies in the oven” and “remove cookies from the oven” operations simply print a
message to the console




THE POINT
implement the 'get oven mitss' and 'put back oven mitts'

There are three left-handed oven mits and three right-handed oven mits

Three kinds of bakers:
Left handed (only need lefthanded) [Left-handed baker 0, Left-handed baker 1....]
Right handed (only need righthanded) [Right-handed baker 0, Right-handed baker 1....]
Cautions (need both, takes left and then right) [Cautious baker 0, Cautious baker 1,....]





YOUR CODE WILL TAKE A FOUR LINE COMMAND ARGUMENET
> number of LHB
> number of RHB
> number of CB
> seed for the random number generator



Each baker must perform its operation 10 times
